# disable-hw-overlays

A simple Magisk module that will disable HW overlays on boot so that you don't need to do it everytime in developer options.

You may fix any stuttering you may be experiencing and make your device's UI more smooth by turning off hardware overlays. It is crucial to remember that turning off HW overlays may also result in certain visual artefacts, like problems with transparency.

When HW overlays are enabled, Android uses the CPU to render graphics for specific elements on the screen, such as status bar icons and notifications. Stuttering may result from this strain on the CPU. When HW overlays are disabled, Android renders graphics using the GPU, which may or may not improve performance.
